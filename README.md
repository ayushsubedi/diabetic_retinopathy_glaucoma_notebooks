## Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction
![](https://gadsdeneye.com/wp-content/uploads/diabetic-retinopathy-vector.jpg)

Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the back of the eye (retina). It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. However, it usually takes several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could threaten your sight.

### Priliminary
- [x] collect all previous analysis notebooks
- [x] conduct preliminary EDA (for balanced dataset, missing images etc)
- [x] create balanced test train split for DR (stratify) 
- [x] store the dataset in drive for colab
- [x] identify a few research papers, create a file to store subsequently found research papers
- [x] identify right technology stack to use (for ML, training, PM, model versioning, stage deployment, actual deployment)
- [x] perform basic augmentation
- [x] create a version 0 base model
- [x] apply a random transfer learning model 
- [x] create a metric for evaluation
- [x] store the model in zenodo, or find something for version control
- [x] create a model that takes image as an input
- [x] create a streamlit app that reads model
- [x] streamlit app to upload and test prediction
- [x] test deployment to free tier heroku
- [x] identify gaps
