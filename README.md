## Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction

### Priliminary
- [x] collect all previous analysis notebooks
- [ ] conduct preliminary EDA (for balanced dataset, missing images etc)
- [ ] create balanced test train split for DR (stratify) 
- [ ] store the dataset in drive for colab
- [ ] identify a few research papers, create a file to store subsequently found research papers
- [ ] identify right technology stack to use (for ML, training, PM, model versioning, stage deployment, actual deployment)
- [ ] perform basic augmentation
- [ ] create a version 0 base model
- [ ] apply a random transfer learning model 
- [ ] create a metric for evaluation
- [ ] store the model in zenodo, or find something for version control
- [ ] create a model that takes image as an input
- [ ] create a streamlit app that reads data as an input 
- [ ] research deployment
- [ ]
